# Discuz project by yuDiscuz - yuProduction #

Hi! I'm yugiohhh,

I will share my Discuz Modifications and Discuz Styles with you.

Discuz is a free forum source, which is currently used by a large number of webmasters. However, Modifications and Styles of Discuz are now not as abundant as those of Vbulletin. I will re-write these Modifications and Styles based on the original Vbulletin versions if they are useful and essential.

Moreover, I really appreciate creative ideas from Discuz users, which will help me a lot in developing Discuz resources. You can go to “My Ideas” to post comments about modifications that you want to have. And if those ideas are really useful, I will develop them.

Furthermore, In this webpage, I will collect and re-post some essential resources for website designers. Hope you will enjoy them!
